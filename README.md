# Git conflicts

Conflicts appear when git cannot merge your files automatically. 

Conflicts should ALWAYS be fixed before you merge your branch to master.

You always fix a conflict by reading the file and understanding the reason for the conflict. 

If you cannot solve this yourself, you should ask the person who created the code you are conflicting with because you don't want to break their work.

> Wouter: The dinosaur name needs a css class added to it. It will make it Blink. also add a background of stars.
> Miriam: The dinosaur name needs a prefix of the era it was living in and the sound it makes as a suffix. Also add the era and sound in the DB and seeds.
